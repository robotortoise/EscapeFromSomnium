Obviously, the characters as well as the music tracks are not under this copyright, but the writing itself as well as the art is available to remix. If you're planning on compiling the game by yourself, you'll need Unity 2023 or later, along with the Naninovel and Text Animator plugins. We can't provide those as they're copyrighted â€” but the developers for the plugins are very cool and you should support them.

Enjoy!

Originally released on Itch.io.


Description of the game:

Sigma's vision is shrouded in darkness.  The room he finds himself in is barely lit, with only the glow of an old CRT monitor piercing through the darkness.  Suddenly, a strange man makes his presence known. 

"Who the hell are you?" asks Kaname Date.
